##  Initial Electric Vehicle Lateral and Longitudinal Simulation

This code outputs the efficiency contour maps and lithium-ion cell characteristics. The Simulink model simulates the longitudinal and lateral dynamics of an electric vehicle driving around a track (1 lap) through an XY Graph from the initial values provided in the Matlab script.

Download the updated Project 4 Week 1 Simulink model [MEEN432_Project4_Model.slx](https://github.com/JoshuaSerrano71/MEEN432Sp2025_JoshuaSerrano71/tree/main/Project4/MEEN432_Project4_Model.slx) and main Matlab code [Project4_init.m](https://github.com/JoshuaSerrano71/MEEN432Sp2025_JoshuaSerrano71/blob/main/Project4/Project4_init.m) <br>
<br>
<br>

```markdown
Procedure
```
- Place all the files into the same folder and open the folder's directory in Matlab. <br>
- Run the Project4_init.m script <br>
- Open the MEEN432_Project4_Model.slx Simulink and locate the XY Graph to view the track (*Figure 1*)
- Run the MEEN432_Project4_Model.slx Simulink <br>
