# Project	3	Week	1	Submission
##  Longitudinal simulation model of a vehicle

The following Matlab code takes Dynamometer data from the epa.gov website under their fuel and emissions testing section for Urban and Highway driving.

Download Instructions
```
Download the Matlab code [Project3_init.m](https://github.com/JoshuaSerrano71/MEEN432Sp2025_JoshuaSerrano71/tree/main/Project3/Part1/Project3_init.m) and the Simulink simulation [MEEN432_Project3_start.slx](https://github.com/JoshuaSerrano71/MEEN432Sp2025_JoshuaSerrano71/tree/main/Project3/Part1/MEEN432_Project3_start.slx) <br>

The following Matlab code contains velocity dynamometer values from the EPA for Urban and Highway Driving: <br>
Urban EPA Data (2 cycles): [init_urban_epa_2cycle.m](https://github.com/JoshuaSerrano71/MEEN432Sp2025_JoshuaSerrano71/tree/main/Project3/Part1/init_urban_epa_2cycle.m) <br>
Highway EPA Data: [init_highway_epa.m](https://github.com/JoshuaSerrano71/MEEN432Sp2025_JoshuaSerrano71/tree/main/Project3/Part1/init_highway_epa.m) <br>

Once both Week 1 files are downloaded, place them into the same folder and open the folder's directory in Matlab. <br>
