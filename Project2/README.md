This matlab script will plot the race track using only one set of x variables making it one continuous line that starts and ends at the origin.
It also plots a patch, the car, moving around the track with xc, yc being the center point of the patch/car.
The trail of the patch is also animated as a blue line based on the xc and yc values stated ealier.
The script will run completely when 'Run' is hit and no other action is required.
